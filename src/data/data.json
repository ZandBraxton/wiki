      "Disco Wonderland (ディスコワンダーランド)is known in the HGG community as the resident White Woman lover. Upon showing interest in Lizzo and a fictional woman known as “Tae”, Disco’s reputation in the gang has been dragged through the mud, with his L’s often being referred to as “common”.",
      "Despite his many shortcomings, Disco has proven himself to be quite strong and has somewhat gained respect from his peers in the realm of physical combat. However, he often ducks his opponents when offered the smoke. “I’m at work” ends up being the usual excuse."

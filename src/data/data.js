      "Disco Wonderland (ディスコワンダーランド) is known in the HGG community as the resident White Woman lover. Upon showing interest in Lizzo and a fictional woman known as “Tae”, Disco’s reputation in the gang has been dragged through the mud, with his L’s often being referred to as “common”.",
      "Despite his many shortcomings, Disco has proven himself to be quite strong and has somewhat gained respect from his peers in the realm of physical combat. However, he often ducks his opponents when offered the smoke. “I’m at work” ends up being the usual excuse.",

He is without a doubt one of the most beloved and respected members in the gang, so much so that he can rally a large group of members behind him just by screaming the word “cock”. It has been rumored that he is related to the nefarious “TronKiller”, but Tron himself has denied these claims and is on a personal mission to eliminate TronKiller once and for all.",

      "ExSeraph (元セラフ) is the resident anime protagonist of the hgg community and for good reason. Much to his dismay, the combination of his silky hair and his beady anime-like eyes made him the subject of just about any edgy anime character reference you can think of. From Sasuke Uchiha, to Cloud Strife to more recently Joker from Persona 5 (if you know you know). He was even mistaken to be a girl at one point which wasn't much of a surprise to anyone.",
      "Despite being confused for a woman there is nothing feminine about Seraph's fighting style. Although his small, slender frame would lead one to believe he fights with skill and finesse, Seraph instead enjoys a more brute and violent approach to beating down his opponents. Kaio, who often ends up being the victim of Seraph's violent tendencies, often states that Seraph is \"too cute for the way he fights.\"",
